Approval phrase for any future Phase 2 dry-run:

```text
APPROVE_HERMES_ADAPTER_PHASE2_DRY_RUN_ONCE
```

Routing remains active:

- Codex is not used for micro tasks.
- Hermes / DeepSeek handles safe micro checks.
- Codex is reserved for complex/risky batch work.

No-touch: Phase 2 was not launched; feature flag was not changed; production remains OFF; no service start/restart/stop/enable/disable was performed; `.env`, `config.py`, token, `os.environ`, DB, live logs and real orders were not read; `.py` code was not changed; git was not used.


## 2026-06-20 — PHASE2_DRY_RUN_FAILED_ROLLBACK_DONE

Status:

```text
PHASE2_DRY_RUN_FAILED_ROLLBACK_DONE
```

Summary:

- Phase 2 dry-run was explicitly approved with `APPROVE_HERMES_ADAPTER_PHASE2_DRY_RUN_ONCE`.
- Precheck passed: SSH verified, service active/running, autostart disabled, feature flag OFF, adapter/hook present.
- Backup created: `/opt/malyarka-telegram-bot/malyarka_core/adapters/telegram.py.phase2_dry_run_backup_20260620`.
- Feature flag was temporarily set ON for controlled dry-run.
- Controlled restart was performed to apply temporary flag.
- Telegram test failed: `700 x 500` was diverted to English clarification (`What is 700 x 500 for?`) instead of expected Malyarka order flow.
- Rollback was executed immediately.
- Feature flag is now OFF.
- Controlled restart was performed to apply rollback.
- Final service state: active/running.
- Autostart remains disabled.
- Production remains OFF.

Created report:

```text
E:\Hermes-Hub\docs\HERMES_ADAPTER_PHASE2_DRY_RUN_REPORT.md
```

Blocker:

```text
Hermes adapter currently interferes incorrectly with simple order-like input `700 x 500`.
```

Next safe step:

```text
Plan-only investigation of adapter dry-run behavior before any future flag enable.
```

No-touch: no production enable, no systemctl enable/stop, no autostart change, no `.env`, `config.py`, token, `os.environ`, DB, live logs or real orders read, no adapter logic change, no git.
